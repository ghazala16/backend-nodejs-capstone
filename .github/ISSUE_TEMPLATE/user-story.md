As a registered user,
I need a secure login feature,
So that I can safely access my personalized dashboard and data.

##*Details and Assumptions*
The login feature will use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.

Passwords must be encrypted using bcrypt before storage in MongoDB.

The API endpoint for login should validate credentials and issue a token.

Users will need to provide email/username and password to authenticate.

Frontend is expected to store the token securely (e.g., HTTP-only cookies or localStorage).

Error messages should be generic to prevent information disclosure.

##* *Acceptance Criteria* *
Given a user with a valid registered account,
When the user submits the correct email/username and password,
Then the system authenticates the user and returns a valid JWT token.

Given a user with incorrect credentials,
When the login request is made,
Then the system rejects the login with an appropriate error message without disclosing specifics.
